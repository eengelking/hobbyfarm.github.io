HobbyFarm is a browser-based cloud native training tool. It was founded on the principle that a learner should not require an advanced workstation or lots of cloud resources just to learn cloud-native technologies. 

## Origin

[Rancher Labs](https://rancher.com) operates live training sessions called "Rodeos" which are used to educate engineers and developers on containers, Kubernetes, and Rancher technologies. These rodeos (prior to the 2019 COVID pandemic) used to be conducted in-person at various hotel, conference, or private locations. The rodeos consisted of a morning of slide presentations and knowledge transfer, along with an afternoon of hands-on labs. These labs were conducted using virtual machines on the attendees' devices, usually via Virtual Box. This was a troublesome process as attendees often had low-power devices, slow WiFi at the venue, insufficient disk space, networking issues, etc. 

After suffering through these issues, the original developers of the software (Eamon Bauman and Chris Kim) were tasked with finding a replacement. Unsatisifed with offerings currently on the market, the two thought (maybe with a little hubris ;) ) that they could build something to their needs. HobbyFarm was born. 

Using HobbyFarm, developers and engineers no longer required a powerful laptop or significant cloud resources to execute the hands-on portion of the rodeo. Rancher Labs staff could spend more time on education and delivering content, and less time on fixing issues with the older virtual machine setup. Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Rancher Labs (and, subsequently, SUSE) switched to providing these Rodeos virtually using teleconferencing technology. HobbyFarm adjusted with them and was able to continue providing the same user experience over a long distance as it was in-person.
