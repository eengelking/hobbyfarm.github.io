## Contributor Code of Conduct

A more formal definition to come. For now, here's the scoop:

1. Treat _everyone_ with kindness and respect. 
2. Behavior or language that is intolerant, disrespectful, rude, or derogatory towards anyone is not allowed.
3. Inclusion is central to this project. _All_ who follow these rules are welcome.
